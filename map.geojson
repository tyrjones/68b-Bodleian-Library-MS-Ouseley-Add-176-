    "description":"The Third Trial of Rustam is an exciting story of how the Iranian hero Rustam slays a dragon on his way to free the Persian Emperor. It comes from the Shahnama, a book describing the myths and histories of heroes and kings since the beginning of Persian history. Rustam is a character whose life and tales are extensively explored in the book. The Seven Trials of Rustam are instrumental in his evolution into becoming a national hero. His legacy is that he is known as a great warrior, but Rustam never sits on the Iranian throne (Skjærvø, 1998, 163). \n\nIn this scene, Rustam falls asleep and his loyal horse Raksh wakes him up after a dragon is seen lurking nearby. After being unable to see it for first few times he is awaken, Rustam finally is able to see the dragon. He asks the dragon what its name is. The dragon ignores this and tells Rustam that no one survives the clutches of the dragon, so he asks what the man’s name is. Rustam replies with his name, and tells the dragon that he will vanquish him. The fighting begins between man and dragon. Raksh helps Rustam by sinking his teeth between the dragon’s shoulders to hold him. Rustam then cuts the head of the dragon off. This gives Rustam great confidence for the rest of his journey."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
